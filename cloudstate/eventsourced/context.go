// state actions requested by the command handler.

// run in a "fire and forget" fashion. The code flow of the caller (the command
// handler of the entity which emitted the async command) continues while the
// command is being asynchronously processed. Meanwhile, synchronous commands
// run in "blocking" mode, ie. the commands are processed in order, one at a time.

//
