= Getting started with Cloudstate services in Go

include::partial$attributes.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

Go version:: Cloudstate Go support requires at least Go {cloudstate-go-version}

Build tool:: Cloudstate does not require any particular build tool, you can select your own.

protoc::
Since Cloudstate is based on gRPC services, you need a protoc compiler to compile gRPC protobuf descriptors.
This can be done manually through the https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/#prerequisites[gRPC Project] where it's described how to install the protocol compiler as well as the go-protobuf and grpc compiler plugins for Go.

docker:
Cloudstate runs in Kubernetes with https://www.docker.com[Docker], hence you will need Docker to build a container that you can deploy to Kubernetes.

In addition to the above, you will need to install the Cloudstate Go language support library by issuing `go get -u github.com/cloudstateio/go-support/cloudstate` or with Go module support let the dependency be downloaded by `go [build|run|test]`.

By using the Go module support your go.mod file will reference the latest version of the support library or you can define which version you like to use.

[.tabset]
go get::
+
[source,shell"]
----
go get -u github.com/cloudstateio/go-support/cloudstate
----

import path::
+
[source,go]
----
import "github.com/cloudstateio/go-support/cloudstate"
----

go.mod::
+
[source,go,subs="attributes+"]
----
module example.com/yourpackage
  require (
      github.com/cloudstateio/go-support {cloudstate-go-lib-version}
  )
go {cloudstate-go-version}
----

== Protobuf files

The Cloudstate Go Support Library provides no dedicated tool beside the protoc compiler to build your protobuf files.
The Cloudstate protocol protobuf files as well as the shopping cart example application protobuf files are provided by the Cloudstate Repository.

In addition to the `protoc` compiler, the gRPC Go plugin is needed to compile the protobuf file to `*.pb.go` files.
Please follow the instructions at the https://github.com/golang/protobuf[Go support for Protocol Buffers] project page to install the protoc compiler as well as the `protoc-gen-go` plugin which also includes the Google standard protobuf types.

To build the example shopping cart application shown earlier in xref:concepts:grpc.adoc[gRPC descriptors], you could simply paste that protobuf into a file named `shoppingcart.proto`.
You may wish to also define the Go package using the `go_package` proto option, to ensure the package name used conforms to Go package naming conventions.

[source,protobuf]
----
option go_package = "example.com/shoppingcart;shoppingcart";
----

Now if you place your protobuf files under `protobuf/` and run `protoc --go_out=.
--proto_path=protobuf ./protobuf/*.proto`, you'll find your generated protobuf files under `shoppingcart`.

== Creating a main package

Your main package will be responsible for creating the Cloudstate gRPC server, registering the entities for it to serve, and starting it.
To do this, you can use the CloudState server type, for example:

[source,go]
----
include::example$tck/cmd/tck_eventsourced/tck_eventsourced.go[tag=shopping-cart-main]
----

We will see more details on registering entities in the coming pages.

== Interfaces to be implemented

Cloudstate entities in Go work by implementing interfaces and registering those entities with a Cloudstate instance.
During the registration of the entity an entity factory function, {cloudstate-go-lib-api-base}/cloudstate/eventsourced#Entity.EntityFunc[`eventsourced.Entity.EntityFunc`], has to be provided so that Cloudstate gets to know how to create and initialize an event sourced entity.

[source,go]
----
include::example$example/shoppingcart/entity.go[tag=entity-func]
----

This entity factory function returns a type that implements the {cloudstate-go-lib-api-base}/cloudstate/eventsourced#EntityHandler[`eventsourced.EntityHandler`] interface.
An entity can implement the optional {cloudstate-go-lib-api-base}/cloudstate/eventsourced#Snapshooter[`eventsourced.Snapshooter`] interface if it likes to enable snapshot functionality.
We will see later how to handle snapshots on the following pages.
